## Reviewer notes

- This submission is a derivative version of the existing MTI/Bilibili history extension project. The known upstream repository is `https://github.com/mundane799699/bilibili-history-wxt`; attribution is kept in `NOTICE` and the MIT license text is kept in `LICENSE`.
- Source is TypeScript/React and is bundled by WXT/Vite. There is no obfuscated or remotely executed code.
- The extension only contacts `bilibili.com` to read the signed-in user's history.
- Cloud sync is optional, disabled by default, and runs only after the user enters an HTTPS endpoint and explicitly clicks a test or sync button.
- On Firefox, the cloud-sync action requests optional `authenticationInfo` and `browsingActivity` data-collection permissions before transmitting anything.
- A Bilibili account is only needed to exercise history import. The record browser, settings, backup import, and analytics pages can be reviewed without developer-provided credentials.

## Firefox linter notes

`web-ext lint --source-dir .output/firefox-mv2` returns 0 errors and 0 notices. The remaining warnings are two `UNSAFE_VAR_ASSIGNMENT` warnings for `innerHTML` in `chunks/dist-*.js`.

These warnings point into bundled `react-dom` runtime branches:

- creating a script element in React's DOM implementation;
- React's generic `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` property branch.

The project source does not call `innerHTML` or use `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`. Searching `entrypoints/`, `pages/`, `components/`, and `utils/` for `innerHTML` and `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` returns no matches.
